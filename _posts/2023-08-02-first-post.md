Hi! My name is *Nur Farisha* and I am 25 years old. I recently completed a Bachelor of Information Technology (Hons.) Information System degree at Multimedia University and am now undergoing my first real job in DHL IT Services as their Graduate Trainee - Application Support. I am a strong believer that persistence pays off in the end, and I am positive that each day that I persist, puts me closer to achieving my objectives.
